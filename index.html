                            I am an American-German midwife and researcher who has lived and worked in Germany 
                            for nearly forty years. My path into midwifery began with a deep curiosity about 
                            birth as both a biological and cultural phenomenon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After qualifying as a midwife in 2001, I practised in a wide range of settings, 
                            including hospital delivery wards and a free-standing birth centre. I currently 
                            work in a hospital-based midwifery team, where I continue to combine hands-on 
                            practice with a reflective, research-informed approach to care.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alongside my clinical work, I have always been drawn to questions of how knowledge 
                            is created, shared, and embodied in midwifery. I studied sociology (B.A.) and public 
                            health (MscPH) before completing my PhD in Community Health and Midwifery at the 
                            University of Central Lancashire in 2019.

                            This book explores how newly qualified midwives acquire the practical skills and 
                            confidence that shape their early professional identities. Drawing from extensive 
                            research across German birth centres, it reveals how learning in midwifery is far 
                            more than skill acquisition—it is a process of becoming, reflection, and shared 
                            experience between generations of midwives.

                        My writing, both academic and reflective, often draws inspiration from literature, 
                        mythology, and narrative, viewing birth as a profoundly human encounter that resists 
                        simplification. I am committed to the transmission of knowledge between generations 
                        of midwives and am guided by the conviction that each birth invites us to always 
                        approach care as an interaction rather than a procedure.
